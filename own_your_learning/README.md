# Owning your Learning

## Concepts

For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

- [Technical Questioning](resources/tech_questioning.md)
- [The Framework](resources/framework.md)
- [Peer Learning Day - How To Get Started](resources/pld.md)
- [Approaching a Project](resources/approaching_projects.md)

## Resources

Read or watch

- [The Feynman Learning technique](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/)
- [How I tackle projects at ALX (Learn from Firdaus Salim)](https://medium.com/alx-africa/how-i-tackle-my-software-engineering-projects-at-alx-610f3f5a6448)

- [Focus and diffuse mode of thinking read](https://www.brainscape.com/academy/focused-vs-diffuse-thinking-learning/)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- what steps do i need to learn how to learn?
- What is the Feynman learning technique and how can I implement it?
- What does it mean to own my own learning journey?
- In what ways can I crack through if I don’t get it***:)“

### Quiz questions

Question #0
Which of the following is true about the Feynman learning technique (Select all that apply)


Because learning doesn’t happen from skimming through a book or remembering enough to pass a test


Ultimately, the point of learning is to understand the world"


Information is learned when you can explain it and use it in a wide variety of situations.

Question #1
“Which of the following is not a step in the Faynmen learning technique


Pretend to teach a concept you want to learn about to a student in the sixth grade.


Organize and simplify.


make things bigger, more complex


Identify gaps in your explanation. Go back to the source material to better understand it.

Question #2
When Asking a peer for help, it is important to remember… (Select all that apply)


it’s your job to ask and it’s your job to help


Explain what the problem is and what you’ve tried"


Respect other people’s time

Question #3
“When giving help to a peer, it is important to… (Select all that apply)

”


Respect every question; there is nothing more demotivating than having someone laughing at your question or being asked “what? you still don’t know that?”


There are no stupid questions


Do NOT give the final answer. You are here to guide, help them find the solution by themselves.

Question #4
Why you should ask and answer technical questions?


You learn how to ask questions


You learn by answering questions


You will gain a better understanding of the problem

Tips:
Read the concept page Technical Questioning

Question #5
How do you ask good technical questions?


Sum up your question in a title


Share what you’ve already tried


Provide code sample


Provide screenshots


Provide context


Format, Lint, and Document Your Code

Tips:
Read the concept page Technical Questioning

Question #6
Which is more important: focused vs. diffuse thinking?


Focused thinking, your brain processes very specific information deeply


Both are required in order to master a topic or make progress on a difficult project. When you are learning something new, you need to understand both the context for the information (diffuse) and the specifics of the subject (focused).


Diffuse thinking, the brain analyses much more information at once but in less depth

Question #7
If you still can’t find the solution or understand why your code doesn’t work, google it. Which of the following facts should be considered when googling (Select all that apply)


Trust everything on the Intranet


Never copy and paste something from the Internet. You need to understand everything before you implement something you read. Typing yourself - instead of cp/paste - ensures that you better understand and not miss any details.


Only google something specific

Question #8
Which of the following completely describes the difference between focussed thinking and diffused thinking


focussed thinking is like seeing a brick wall and saying it’s just too difficult to run through or climb through while diffused thinking is like your mind saying “"Hey why don’t we tie balloons and just float over it


focussed thinking is like your mind saying “Hey why don’t we tie balloons and just float over it” while diffused thinking is like seeing a brick wall and saying it’s too difficult to run through or climb through.“

Question #9
According to Richard Faynmen, what does it mean to know: (Select all that apply)


The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks


When you know something, the labels are unimportant, because it’s not necessary to keep it in the box it came in.“


When you only know what something is called, you have no real sense of what it is.

Question #10
“which of the following is part of the recommended learning framework within the ALX program. (Select all that apply)


Read the project prerequisites, man pages, documentation, books, and articles. Try all the examples in the docs


Write or draw out your problem on a whiteboard or paper. It’s easier to visualize your problem when it isn’t pure code.


Whether or not your code runs when you input it, make sure you know why it doesn’t (or does) work without looking at the error message.


Pause, take a breath, and think of the solution. Make sure you understand all of the required concepts and algorithms before you proceed to solve tasks.
