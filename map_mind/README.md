## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General:

- What is a Pseudocode?
- why is Pseudocoding important in programming?
- How do you write Pseudocodes?

### Quiz questions

#### Question #0

**Is pseudocode a programming language**

[ ] yes
[x] No

#### Question #1

**which of the following statement is true about pseudocodes**

[x] Itâ€™s simply an implementation of an algorithm in the form of annotations and informative text written in plain English
[x] it acts as a bridge between the program and the algorithm"
[x] pseudocode improves the readability of any approach

### Tasks


**0. Being a square keeps you from going around in circles.**

>
> To develop an algorithm: Calculate the sum of squares of given input of numbers. You are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.
>

**1. Order marches with weighty and measured strides. Disorder is always in a hurry.**

>
> To develop an algorithm that: reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order. You are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.
>

**2. It is not enough to run; one must start in time**

>
> To develop an algorithm: Calculate a running sum. A user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum and when a negative number is encountered, stop adding numbers and write out the final result
> You are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.
