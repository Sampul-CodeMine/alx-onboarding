## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General:

What is a Pseudocode?
why is Pseudocoding important in programming?
How do you write Pseudocodes?

### Quiz questions

Question #0
Is pseudocode a programming language


yes


No

Question #1
which of the following statement is true about pseudocodes


Itâ€™s simply an implementation of an algorithm in the form of annotations and informative text written in plain English


it acts as a bridge between the program and the algorithm"


pseudocode improves the readability of any approach

#### Tasks

0. Being a square keeps you from going around in circles.
mandatory
Score: 50.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)
To develop an algorithm

calculate the sum of squares of given input of numbers

you are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.

Create the algorithm in a flow chart save a screen shot and upload it to google drive, and give access to anyone with the link

2. It is not enough to run; one must start in time
mandatory
Score: 50.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)
To develop an algorithm

Calculate a running sum

A user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum and when a negative number is encountered, stop adding numbers and write out the final result

you are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.
